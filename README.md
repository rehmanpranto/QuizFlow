Ready to start your QuizFlow adventure? Here’s how:

1.  **Clone the Mothership (This Repository):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/quizflow.git](https://github.com/your-username/quizflow.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd quizflow
    ```

2.  **Set Up Your Python Universe (Virtual Environment):**

4.  **Awaken the Database (PostgreSQL Setup):**
    * Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.

    * **Crucial:** Populate your `quizzes` and `questions` tables with at least one quiz and its questions for the app to function correctly.

5.  **Configure Your Secrets (`.env` file):**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
